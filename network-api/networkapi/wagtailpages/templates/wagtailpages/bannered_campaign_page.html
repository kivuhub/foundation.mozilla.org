NOTE:

The following block has been borrowed from the templates/tags/cta/petition.html file,
rather than using the `cta` tag from our mini_site_tags collection, because the cta
tag was written in the assumption that models would only ever have a single CTA field
named "cta", which is an assumption that the bannered campaign page squarely violates.

As such, the CTA tag needs to be refactored to take this into account, however this
work should not be done at the same time as adding signup CTAs to the b.c. pages.

{% block secondary_cta %}
	{% if page.signup %}
    <div
      class="join-us p-2 full-width mb-5"
      data-cta-header="{{ page.signup.header | escape }}"
      data-cta-description="{{ page.signup.description | escape }}"
      data-newsletter="{{ page.signup.newsletter }}">
    </div>
	{% endif %}
{% endblock %}
